The Iceclads are the elites of the Airya clan. They don icicle hauberks, wield ice lances and carry shields. The ice armor is difficult to make and time-consuming to forge. The protection gained from ice armor depends on the temperature of the province. Their ice lances are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
