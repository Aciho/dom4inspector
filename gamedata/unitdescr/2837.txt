The Korybantes are sacred war-dancers of human origin. During the Telkhine reign humans were never initiated in the mysteries of the sacred dance. They were limited to mundane dances mimicking the Hekaterides at best. Now with the imminent awakening of the Lord the Meliai are searching for new adherents and war-dancers. They found new temples on distant shores where the sound of ancient cymbals once more arouse the spirits of dancing men. Korybantes are war-dancers and enter a berserk frenzy when blessed.
